    <h2 class="heading-2">About</h2>
    <p>
    My name is Juan Pablo Echeverry, I am a software developer with a passion for coding and solving problems.<br/>
    I mainly use frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and cool JS frameworks such as React, Next, Vue and Nuxt.<br/>
    I also have implemented backend solutions developing APIs and setting up databases with PostgreSQL and MySQL.<br/>
    When I'm not coding I love to learn about personal finances, and I love indoor rock climbing, haven't tried outdoor climbing yet!!
