      <p class="text-center max-w-lg mx-auto mb-8">
        My name is Juan Pablo Echeverry, I am a software developer with a passion for coding and solving problems.<br />
        I mainly use frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and cool JS frameworks such as React, Next,
        Vue
        and Nuxt.<br />
        I also have implemented backend solutions developing APIs and setting up databases with PostgreSQL and
        MySQL.<br />
        When I'm not coding I love to learn new stuff like 3d modeling, or practice rock climbing.
