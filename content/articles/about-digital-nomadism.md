title: Thinking about digital nomadism
---

I have been highly passive with how I live these past years. Although COVID was really a big reason to justify my lack of movement, I can't keep giving myself that excuse not to go and explore the world.

I have been reading a lot about living abroad and working remotely. It sounds like a fantastic idea that I want to honestly try for a few months or years and see where it takes me. 

The most essential thing as a digital nomad should be the ability to generate an income from anywhere I live.
There are several ways to make money online, but the one I have considered the most is working as a web designer and developer.

The second thing would be choosing an affordable place with a reliable internet connection. That brings us to the next point.

## Where should I go?

There are tons of places to explore, and I want to take these trips slowly and stay for months at a time.
The first option I've been considering is living in Medellin, Colombia. There is a little bit of cheating in choosing this location because I was born and raised in Colombia, but I didn't live in that city, so it's still a somewhat new place for me to live.
After being there for about 6 to 9 months, I will choose a different location. 
The following location will depend on how much money I can generate consistently. If I make a good amount, I could try visiting a relatively expensive place like Paris, London or Berlin. 
I will most likely not generate such amounts of money, so I am open to more affordable locations like Buenos Aires or Bangkok.


## What if anything goes wrong?

I have been paralyzed for a long time by fear, and exploring the world is something that I genuinely want to try. Worst case scenario, I can always just fly back to the US to work as a waiter temporarily to pay for rent. That doesn't sound like the end of the world, and staying in the same place is not what I want to do with my life. We are only here for a limited time, and we have the power to go wherever we want to go.
