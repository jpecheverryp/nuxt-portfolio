title: Why am I writing a blog?
---

Hi, my name is Juan Echeverry and this is my blog.
There are several reasons I want to write a blog and I will list them here.

## Documenting my Journey

I enjoy coding and learning new things about tech, I see this as an opportunity to document my progress in life, this is a way I can go back in the future and see where I came from. I will use this blog to write about new things I'm learning and new subjects I'd like to learn in the future.

## To learn how to write

I have always been pretty bad at writing, my first language is Spanish and I have always had problems expressing my ideas even writing or talkig in my mother tongue. I am writing so I can become better at it.
I don't feel confident doing it, but that's the reason I'm doing it. I am goning to try my best to be consistent at it.
"Competence comes from repetition and confidence comes from competence"

## To create more

I want to create stuff, I have been learning to code so I can create web apps, I'd like to learn how to write, how to draw, how to create animations, and yet I am always paralyzed by because I feel like I need everything to either be perfect or not exist, and that is a terrible way of thinking about it.
I want to create more imperfect things and change them over time, so I can perfect them later.

## To connect with others

I know I'm not the only one who thinks like this, there are people all over the world who can relate to what I have to say, and I'd love to meet with a lot more people, I will leave my email in this page, and probably will add a contact form too. If you are reading this blog and would like to send me an email, please do not hesitate!


That's probably it for today, I will be trying to write as often as possible.
